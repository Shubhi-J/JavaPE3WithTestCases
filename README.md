It contains 8 java programs

In this exercise I solved problems like

1.Created a class called StudentMarks, which prompts user for the number of students, reads it
from the keyboard, and saves it in an int variable called numOfStudents. It then prompts user for the
grades of each of the students and saves them in an int array called stuGrades. program checks that
the grade is between 0 and 100 else has to trow an error message.

6.A program to find out if a series of 7 digits are consecutive numbers.

7.Created a class with a main( ) that throws an object of class Exception inside a try block.
a. Gave the constructor for Exception a String argument.
